## Technical Details

### Components

- **BootReceiver**: Ensures notifications resume after device reboot

### Architecture

- Built with Kotlin
- Uses Jetpack Compose for UI elements
- Implements coroutines for asynchronous operations

### Permissions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The application requires notification permissions to function properly. Be sure of permissions are properly granted.

## How It Works

1. The app schedules a daily alarm for 10:00 AM
2. When triggered, it connects to the RAE API to fetch the word of the day
3. It parses the word and its definition from the HTML response
4. A notification is created with the parsed content
5. Tapping the notification opens the complete definition on the RAE website

## Development

This project demonstrates several Android development concepts:

- Broadcast Receivers for system events
- Alarm scheduling with AlarmManager
- Network requests and HTML parsing
- Notification channel creation and management
- Permission handling
- Coroutines for background tasks
